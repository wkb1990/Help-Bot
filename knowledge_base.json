      "question": "My product is not listed in Xplan or the APL",
      "answer": "There is only one setting with editing products in XPLAN and it is not accessible to all individual users. Allocating it to individuals on a group site means that we run the risk that users accidentally edit products that others are using and delete things inadvertently, this has occurred multiple times with substantial impact and so it no longer available. \n\nIf there are a couple of products (2-5) that you regularly use that are unlisted you are welcome to send the details through to be added, however we only update the asset allocation, pricing, and costs of these once or twice a year. It is recommended to ask the fund manager to add the data via the FundData platform and maintain up-to-date information."

This is because Macquarie only sends three years worth of data (a rolling three-year period which moves every day). Transaction data for three years prior drops off and cannot be reinstated as Mac no longer sends it. You need to add a purchase (we call it a balancing transaction) to bring it into line with the correct balance."
